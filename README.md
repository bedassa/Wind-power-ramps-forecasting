# Wind-Power-Ramps-Forecasting-GFS
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/your-badge-informational) 


In this github, the forecast of wind power production are demonstrated for the Belgian aggregated offshore wind power production. Some of the common types of neural network architecture are used. To generate wind power forecast, the wind speed forecast is obtained from Global Forecast System (GFS). Prior to use the neural network to generate the forecast, some preprocesses are performed if you want to use different data sources by using the aggregated wind power and the GFS wind speed values which are:

    1.  Spatial correlation 
    
   Identify the GFS grids that have high correlation with wind speed
   
    2. Data imbalance  
    
    3. Develop Power Curve
    
    4. Generate GFS Wind Power 
    
However, these four steps are not required to run the neural network in this folder.
