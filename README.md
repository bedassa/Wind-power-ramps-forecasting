# Wind-Power-Ramps-Forecasting-GFS
In this github, the forecast of wind power production are demonstrated for the Belgian aggregated offshore wind power production. Some of the common types of neural network architecture are used. To generate wind power forecast, the wind speed forecast is obtained from Global Forecast System (GFS). Prior to use the neural network to generate the forecast, some preprocesses are performed using the aggregated wind power and the GFS wind speed values which are:

* Spatial correlation 
## 1\. This 
1\. step 1
  * run file1
  * run file 2
 ## 2\. load packages
 
 ### 3\. model development
